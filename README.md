            <h4>Amur Leopard: </h4>
            <p> The Amur Leopard is one of the world’s most endangered big cats, with only around 100 left in the wild. It lives in the forests of the Russian Far East and northeastern China. Major threats include habitat loss, poaching, and low reproduction. Conservation efforts like national parks, anti-poaching patrols, and breeding programs aim to save the species from extinction </p>

            <h4> Javan Rhino: </h4>
            <p> The Javan Rhino (Rhinoceros sondaicus) is one of the rarest large mammals in the world, with fewer than 80 individuals remaining in the wild. It is found only in Ujung Kulon National Park in Indonesia. This species is Critically Endangered due to habitat loss, natural disasters, and a very limited range. Unlike other rhino species, it is not targeted heavily by poachers, but its low population and restricted habitat make it highly vulnerable. Conservation efforts focus on strict protection of its habitat, regular monitoring, and preventing human encroachment to ensure its survival.</p>

            <h4>Mountain Gorilla</h4>
            <p> The Mountain Gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is a subspecies of the eastern gorilla, living in the forested mountains of Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. With just over 1,000 individuals remaining, it is listed as Endangered. Threats include habitat loss, poaching, human conflict, and disease. Despite these challenges, conservation efforts such as anti-poaching patrols, veterinary care, and ecotourism support have led to a gradual increase in population, offering hope for the species’ future survival.</p>
